// Find the nth element in the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci sequence starts with a 
// 0 followed by a 1. After that, every value is the sum of the two values preceding it. 
//Here are the first seven values as an example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

function Fibonacci(num) {
//integer of numbers and all positive
//return the sum of last two values
//fib(4) => 0, 1, 1, 2 => 2 + 1 = 3
//fib(7) => 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 => 8 + 5 = 13
