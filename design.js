//create a class that has two methods
//remove method 
    //- it should print from the number 1
    //if you print a number, you can assume its removed
    //and each time you call print, you should print the next number
    //remove, removes the smallest number starting with 1

//add method:
//add back any removed numbers
//add an integer

//print inifinite numbers

//ex: remove, remove, remove, add(3), add(1), remove, remove
       //1 ,    2 ,     3,     1,    3
