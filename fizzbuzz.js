Given a number as an input, print out every integer from 1 to that number. 
However, when the integer is divisible by 3, print out “Fizz”; 
when it’s divisible by 5, print out “Buzz”; 
when it’s divisible by both 3 and 5, print out “Fizz Buzz”.



const fizz = (number) => {
    //get number as an input
    //return if # is / 3 = "fizz", # is / 5 = "buzz", # is / 3 & / 5 = "fizz buzz"
    //fizz(35) => "buzz", divisible by 5
}
