//objective: pick a pivot value
//move values smaller of the value to th left
//move values bigger to the right
//then the pivot value will naturally be in the correct sorted position
//typically start out with the first value in the array as the pivot value


//!always swap left and right number when the left number is greater than pivot and right
//!number is less than the pivot

//using recursion; apply quick sort on two subarrays at same time
//apply quick sort on the smallest of two subarrays to get O(n log(n)) space
