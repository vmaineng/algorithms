// You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. 
// You can perform this operation at most k times.

// Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.
 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

const longestRepeat = (s, k) => {
//s is a string of uppercase letters, k is an integer of how many switches possible
//return max length if k limit has been reached in stringx
//"JUMPPOTI", 4 => "UMPP" => "PPPP"

//brute force
//initialize a length to keep track
//iterate through the strings; 
//

}


//objective: put a window up for the substring as long as the changes are <= k
